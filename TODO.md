## Planned Improvements

- [ ] Consider showing mutation group percentages (% of cells with 0/1/2 mutations) in pie chart centers when no cancer type is selected

- [ ] Ensure exported 3-panel images fully match the on-screen display (cancer type highlighting in export)

- [ ] Create additional infographics/documentation for the app

- [ ] When synonym/orthologues are used, the network iamge doesnt recognize the LFC/FDR of the synonym/orthologues and displays it as "missing" (=gray)

- [ ] Could a feature be used where n genes, not found in the uploaded gene set, are included in the network analysis? eg setting n=10, look for the top 10 strongest correlating genes with each of the uploaded genes, and whow them (indicated as not part of the original gene set), if they connect at least two genes of the uploaded gene set.
