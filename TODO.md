## Planned Improvements

- [ ] Consider showing mutation group percentages (% of cells with 0/1/2 mutations) in pie chart centers when no cancer type is selected

- [ ] Ensure exported 3-panel images fully match the on-screen display (cancer type highlighting in export)

- [ ] Create additional infographics/documentation for the app
